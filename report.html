<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>As a group, we are inspired by the historical changes in the health
problems in a community, mortality patterns, and leading causes of death
that we learned in our Principles of Epidemiology class. In 1839 cholera
was reported as the primary cause of death in England. Nowadays, the
leading cause of death in England, like in the US and most
industrialized countries, is heart disease, with social and racial
disparities in mortality from chronic diseases becoming the major
challenge.</p>
<p>For this project, we started with a general question: What are the
leading causes of death in NYC? We decided to focus on NYC as it’s the
largest city in the US and one of the world’s most diverse cities. We
found that heart disease, cancer, accidents, chronic lower respiratory
disease, and stroke are the most prevalent causes in the city. We also
considered other pertinent causes of death such as pregnancy-related
mortality. This initial exploratory analysis led us to want to explore
specific questions based on our interests and research experience. We
chose the period of 2007-2019 to focus on the modern causes of death in
the city to avoid confounding factors of death due to the COVID-19
outbreak (2019 onward).</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="questions-and-planned-analyses" class="section level2">
<h2>Questions and Planned Analyses</h2>
<p>Each team member decided to focus on a specific cause of death and an
individual-level factor (i.e., age, income, education level, etc.) that
contributed to the changes in leading causes of death observed in the
past 12 years. Below are some of the specific questions we explore in
our analysis:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Heart Disease Related Death is one of the top leading causes of
death in New York City. What is the relationship between age groups,
sex, race, and heart disease related death?</p></li>
<li><p>There has been a notable stark discrepancy in maternal mortality
(pregnancy-related deaths) in minority women. Is there a relationship
between pregnancy-related deaths and the predictors of race and other
factors?</p></li>
<li><p>We were also interested in examining cancer incidence and
mortality rates as cancer of all forms is the second leading cause of
death in New York City. What are the different social factors that can
play a role in cancer rates we examined income levels across New York
City? Are these predictors of cancer incidence and mortality rates
across the city?</p></li>
<li><p>HIV/AIDS is no longer a death sentence, but it still
disproportionately affects low-and-middle-income countries and minority
communities in the USA. What are the current trends in HIV/AIDS
diagnosis and mortality rate in NYC? Do these trends vary by race and
ethnicity? Is the HIV/AIDS mortality rate the same in all NYC
neighborhoods?</p></li>
<li><p>There are stark differences between the leading causes of death
among age groups. What were the leading causes of death by age group? Is
there a relationship between age group as a predictor of Suicide Deaths
and Opioid Poisoning Deaths?</p></li>

<p>Data was obtained from the Health Department of New York State. The

</ol>
<p>For the HIV analysis, we used the data reported to the HIV
Epidemiology and Field Services Program in 2016. All data shown is for
people ages 13 and older. Working with this data was challenging, as
borough-wide and citywide totals sometimes included cases assigned to a
borough with an unknown neighborhood or NYC with an unknown borough.
Therefore, UHF totals didn’t sum to borough totals, and the borough
didn’t add to citywide totals. This made calculating averages and the
total number of deaths challenging. We had to be especially careful when
using <code>select</code> and <code>filter</code> to analyze the data,
as we had to ensure we had extracted the correct data and had the
expected number of cells and rows to make each plot.</p>
<p>The main columns of interest for our analysis are:</p>
<p><code>year</code>: calendar year</p>
<p><code>borough</code>: borough of residence</p>

<h2>EDA</h2>
<p>According to a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s (CDC) National Center, New York ranked the third-highest
average life expectancy at 80.7 years. The average woman in New York
lives until 83.1 years; the average man lives 78.2 years. To better
understand New York City’s causes of death and mortality trends in the
city, we conducted some exploration, mainly through visualization.<br />
We found that heart disease, cancer, accidents, chronic lower, and
stroke are the most prevalent causes in the city.</p>
<p>As explained in the data processing and cleaning, we originally
wanted each to focus on one of the causes. However, we had limitations
in finding publicly available data for the five leading causes of death.
Therefore, we decided to conduct further exploratory analysis, focus on
data available through the city administration, and focus our research
on individual factors of interest.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Heart Disease</li>
</ol>
<p>To investigate the association between age groups, sex, race with
heart disease related death, We fitted a lasso model for model selection
to determine the variables that should be included. We used
cross-validation to find the best lambda for the lasso model and plotted
the lasso model. From the plot, most of the predictors did not reach 0
before the line, which means that we can include most of our predictors.
Then we fitted a multiple linear regression model to analyze the
relationship between age groups, sex, race with heart disease related
death. Lastly, we graphed the boxplots of age groups, race and sex
related to heart disease deaths by order.</p>

<li>Trends in Maternal Mortality</li>
</ol>
<p>Maternal Mortality has been a cause of death for mothers due to a
variety of factors that seem preventable or modifiable. To determine the
underlying or root of these causes. It is because of this we chose to
look deeper into maternal mortality.</p>
<p>Maternal Deaths in New York City:</p>
<p>New York City is a diverse and large population with a 100,000 +
babies born per year in NYC alone.However there is an alarming statistic
of pregnancy-related mortality is on average 9.4 times higher for Black
compared to White mothers. We know that disparities in health outcomes
rarely occur in isolation, and communities of color in our city face
differential access to power and resources such as generational wealth,
access tohealthy food, and access to parks and public spaces, as well as
overexposure to harmful conditions such as environmental damage, over
policing and disproportionate incarceration (NYC Health). Together these
factors lead to chronic stress and disease among communities of color,
which drive the health disparity in pregnancy-associated mortality
across the city and is the focus of this exploratory data analysis:</p>

<p>To analyze any potential relationship between income levels and
cancer incidence and mortality rates we first visualized, through
scatterplots, the median household income per borough to get a better
idea of any trends over time. From this, we determined that Manhattan
had the highest median household income per year, while the Bronx had
the lowest and the rates remained largely constant over time for each
borough. Then we plotted the distribution of median incomes per borough
to understand the most frequent values of median household income in
each borough as well as showing the dispersion and most frequent values

<p>Then we used scatterplots and line plots to visualize cancer
incidence, mortality rates, and median household incomes per borough to
observe any trends over time. After completing this step, we decided to
make the linear model more specific by examining the neighborhoods
within each borough and its corresponding median household income and
cancer incidence rates. We accomplished this by first plotting each
neighborhood’s respective median household income vs cancer incidence
rates from 2015 – 2019. Then after observing the trends from this graph,
we fit a linear model using each borough’s respective median household
income data and cancer incidence data.</p>

<li>Trends in HIV/AIDS Related Deaths</li>
</ol>
<p>New York City was affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic more than any
other U.S. city. When AIDS was first discovered in 1891, little was
known about the mysterious disease rapidly spreading through the city
and disproportionately affecting gay men. Doctors had no clue about the
diseases’ origin, and there was no medical treatment. As a result,
people with AIDS were essentially given a death sentence. A CDC report
from 1987 estimated that 70,000 people in NYC had AIDS, and AIDS cases
in NYC accounted for 30% of AIDS cases in the USA. The same report
stated that of all AIDS cases in reported in NYC, 51% of adults and 59%
of children have died. By the end of 192, AIDS had become the number one
cause of death for U.S. men ages 25 to 44. More than one million
Americans were infected with HIV, and nearly 10 million people were
infected with HIV worldwide. Given New York City’s history with
HIV/AIDS, we wanted to explore recent HIV/AIDS data mortality data.
Since access to diagnosis and treatment is now widely available
throughout the city, we were interested in analyzing trends in
HIV-related deaths accounting by sociodemographic factors such as race,
age, sex, and NYC borough.</p>
<p>We first plotted the number the total number of HIV-related Deaths in
NYC between the years 2011-2015:</p>

<p>Not everyone has the same access to HIV/AIDS care and early
diagnosis, and access to medical services, in general, differs
substantially by race, income, and neighborhood. Therefore, in the
following sections, we will focus on our analysis of how the decline in
HIV/AIDS-related deaths varies by race/ethnicity, age, sex, and NYC
borough.</p>

<p>Historically, it is known that the elderly have the highest death

<p>Though we find that Heart Disease, Cancer, Unintentional Injury,
Accidents, and Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases are the leading causes
of death for the overall population of New York City, it is a known fact
that the elderly are more likely to be victims of these diseases. The
purpose of age group as a predictor of death is to analyze if there are
differences in leading causes of death among different age groups.</p>

<p>Using the vital statistics of death data from the New York State
Bureau of Vital and Health Statistics, our visual points to visible
differences in leading causes of death among the age groups. Accidents
seem to be a more frequent cause of death for the age groups of 25-34
and 35-44, while for individuals who are 45+ the frequency of death by
diseases of the heart and malignant neoplasms is larger. While among the
youth accidents have higher cases of death in New York.</p>

<p>In relation to our initial analysis on age group as a predictor of
death, we were interested in leading causes of death among younger age
groups, one such cause of death is suicide which has become the second
leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10-14 and
25-34. Another cause of death of interest for the predictor of age group
we chose was opioid poisoning deaths, as deaths from drug overdoses and
chronic drug abuse in New York have increased by 71% between 2010 to
2015. . Though suicide and opioid-related deaths are not the leading
causes of death in New York City, the growing death rate in these
categories has been a concern to the medical and public health
community.</p>
<p>To observe the relationship between <code>age_group</code> as a
predictor and the outcomes of a suicide death and an opioid poisoning
death we use a simple linear regression model:</p>
<p>Fitting a SLR model for Age Group as a predictor for Suicide
Deaths:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># SLR model 

s_fit = lm(suicide_deaths ~ age_group, data = predictor_age) 

  

 s_fit %&gt;%  

  broom::tidy() %&gt;%  

  filter(p.value &lt; 0.05) %&gt;% 

   select(term, estimate, p.value) %&gt;% 

  knitr::kable() </code></pre>

<h2>Results &amp; Key findings:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>From the multiple linear regression results, age group 75-84,
85+, and race group Hispanic are the significant predictors. From the
boxplots, we can see that the age group 75-84, 85+, and race group
Hispanic are the most susceptible groups to heart disease related death.
There was no significant difference between males and females in terms
of heart disease related deaths. These results correspond with our
multiple linear regression results. Our preliminary analysis indicated
that the elderly over 75 years old are extremely vulnerable to heart
diseases and there is racial disparity in health in NYC as Hispanic is
the most vulnerable race group among all race groups.</p></li>
<li><p>These NYC data support the consistent racial discrepancy observed
in previous news articles Black mothers are at a higher risk of maternal
mortality than any other racial group. Black women are more likely to
die due a pregnancy related cause than any other race or ethnic group as
they has the highest median death rate. Other or Biracial women have the
lowest pregnancy related mortality within the 2016 - 2019 time period
whereas all other races fall in between that spectrum. Brooklyn is the
NYC borough with the highest mortality, with Staten island with the
lowest. Cardiovascular conditions had the highest median pregnancy
related cause of death relative to the other leading causes of pregnancy
related mortality.</p></li>
<li><p>We determined that median household income is not a significant
predictor for cancer incidence rates being evidenced by the linear
regression results obtained in the analysis. The various plots and
statistical tests in our analysis between median household income levels
and cancer incidence/mortality rates did not show a correlation between
the two variables or showed that median household income level as an
insignificant predictor for cancer incidence rates.</p></li>
<li><p>There has been a sharp decline in HIV/AIDs related mortality in
NYC. This steep decline is explained by the significant scientific and
medical advances in HIV diagnosis and treatment in early 2000. However,
the general trends in the city vary significantly by race/ethnicity and
borough. Black and Latino men continue to be disproportionately burdened
by HIV/AIDS. The number of HIV/AIDS-related deaths is significantly
higher in Brox, Brooklyn, and Queens, predominantly black and Latino
boroughs, compared to Manhattan and Staten Island. However, our
prelimary SLR and MLR model indicate that these differences aren’t
explained by race but are primarily driven by other factors, such as
borough of residence and access to early HIV treatment. This result
suggests that differences observed by race/ethnicity in HIV/AIDs deaths
could result from inequities in access to medical care, information, and
resources available in each NYC borough.</p></li>
<li><p>Leading causes of death differ drastically by age group in New
York, accidents leading to death are far more common in the youth than
the elderly. Accidents and Malignant Neoplasms are the leading causes of
death for those in the age groups of 1-44. While there is a shift to the
leading causes of Diseases of the Heart and Malignant Neoplasms as the
leading causes of death for those that are 44+ years of age. From the
simple linear regression, the age group is a significant predictor of
death by suicide and opioid poisoning. In the case of age group as a
predictor for deaths by opioid poisoning, it was a significant factor
for the age groups of 20-64. In the case of age group as a predictor for
suicide deaths, age group was a significant factor for all age groups
except young children between 1 to 9 years of age and those of old age
of 85+ years.</p></li>

<div id="discussion-next-steps" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion &amp; Next steps</h2>
<p>Often death rates are calculated as an age-adjusted death rate,
controlling for the effects of differences in population age
distributions, hence it was interesting to see a stratified analysis of
causes of death by age and to see if the age group of an individual
impacts their likelihood of dying from suicide or drug poisoning. The
results that we found were consistent with the literature, as our
analysis concentrates on pre-COVID era data, it would be interesting to
compare our results to data collected since the pandemic started as
suicide and drug poisoning rates have further increased due to the
pandemic.</p>
<p>From this analysis, there is not enough evidence to determine that
median household income in New York City influences cancer incidence
rates. This could be due to a multitude of reasons, the modeling is
rudimentary as the only predictor for cancer incidence rates was median
household income. It is reasonable to suggest that cancer incidence
should have multiple predictors to be accurately modeled as the
development of cancer is often a multi-faceted occurrence. Additionally,
income may not have any effect on cancer incidence regardless of better
modeling techniques or more robust datasets but a more in-depth analysis
is needed before drawing strict conclusions on the effect of income on
cancer rates.</p>
<p>Lastly, as discussed in the results section, the differences observed
by race and borough in HIV/AIDs related deaths could result from
inequities in income and access to medical care, information, and
resources depending on the NYC borough of residence. Therefore, the next
step is to analyze the observed trends by neighborhood and income and
analyze changes in mortality rates and diagnosis across years to see if
these factors can better explain the differences observed in our
exploratory analysis.</p>

<div id="limitations-to-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations to Analysis</h2>
<p>There are limitations with the scope of our project due to an
inability to find data for our predictors of concern of age group,
income, race, and ethnicity for all the leading causes, which led us to
tackle different research concerns in the overall category of leading
causes of death.</p>
<p>As multiple datasets have been used in our analysis, which often
varies per research question, we faced challenges in the data cleaning
process, often dealing with missing values that occurred during the
merging of datasets. Additionally in terms of modeling, constructing
simple linear regressions based on single predictors is not appropriate
for accurately depicting the multitude of factors that lead to causes of
death such as cancer, heart disease, suicide deaths, opioid poisoning,
HIV, and pregnancy-related deaths.</p>
<p>There is a clear discrepancy in maternal mortality based on race.
Black women are more likely to die due a pregnancy related cause than
any other race or ethnic group. Other or Biracial women have the lowest
pregnancy related mortality within the 2016 - 2019 time period.</p>

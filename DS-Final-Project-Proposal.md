## Team registration and proposal

First, you will define your teams and propose a project. This proposal
should be a half-page to a page in length and include:

## The Tentative Project Title:

NYC Bills of Mortality: Investigating the leading causes of death in New
York City

## The Motivation for this Project:

As a group, we are inspired by the historical changes in the health
problems in a community, mortality patterns, and leading causes of
death. The image below shows a sign in a cemetery in Dudley, England, in
1839. At the time, cholera was the primary cause of death in England.
Nowadays, the leading cause of death in England, like in the US and most
industrialized countries, is heart disease, with social and racial
disparities in mortality from chronic diseases becoming the major
challenge.

In this project, we hope to analyze NYC’s leading causes of death from
2007-2019, focusing on individual-level factors (e.g., personal income)
and community-level factors (e.g., access to green spaces) to better
understand how these factors contribute to the leading causes of the
death in the city. We decided to focus on NYC as it’s the largest city
in the US and one of the world’s most diverse cities. We chose the
period of 2007-2019 to focus on the modern causes of death in the city
while avoiding confounding factors due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

## The Intended Final Products:

Webpage that includes visualizations and test results for the impact of
various predictors such as age, income, race, education status, air
quality, green spaces, etc., on leading causes of death in NYC. Each
page of the website will contain an analysis of a predictor done by each
individual in the group. The final product will be a data story that
contains reference to historical progression of leading causes of death
as informed through epidemiology.

## The Anticipated Data Sources:

Helpful NYC Health Data Resources:

- <https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/>

- <https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/>

- <https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/sparcs/access/>

Income data:

- <https://www.incomebyzipcode.com/newyork>

- <https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/area-median-income.page>

Age Data: \*

- <https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Vital-Statistics-Opioid-Related-Deaths-by-Age-Grou/qabx-2sqw>

- <https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Vital-Statistics-Suicide-Deaths-by-Age-Group-Race-/j6fz-a4ta>

## The Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges:

William Anderson is focusing on analyzing income as a predictor for
different diseases that are the leading cause of death in NYC by
analyzing the following:

- Plot the correlation between income level and life expectancy

- Conduct statistical analysis to understand if income plays a role in
  the survival probability of cancer, heart disease, and other diseases

- Visualize a map of neighborhoods in NYC with certain income levels and
  the number of healthcare facilities within a certain radius

- Stratify the leading causes of death by income level and observe
  trends

Jennifer Osei is focusing on website development & analyzing race and
education as a predictor for different diseases that are the leading
cause of death in NYC by analyzing the following:

- Plot the correlation between race, education, etc.

- Conduct statistical analysis to understand if race or educational
  attainment plays a role in the survival probability of cancer, heart
  disease, and other diseases

- Visualize a map of neighborhoods in NYC by race and education with
  certain and

- Stratify the leading causes of death by race, education and observe
  trends using plots/ dynamic plots (to visualize over time period).

- Data permitting, also want to examine access and type of health
  insurance its relation to death outcomes.

Riya Bhilegaonkar is focusing on analyzing age as a predictor for
different diseases that are the leading cause of death in NYC by
analyzing the following:

\<\<\<\<\<\<\< HEAD \* Plot the correlation between age group and life
expectancy ======= - Plot the correlation between income level and life
expectancy \>\>\>\>\>\>\> 99c06a990f09eb4494caa3d4cd0b46c4f4aaf87c

- Visualization for leading causes of death per age group

- Conduct statistical analysis to understand if race or educational
  attainment plays a role in various diseases:

- Trend between age group and suicide related deaths (ANOVA, Regression
  Analysis).

- Trend between age group and opioid related deaths (ANOVA, Regression
  Analysis).

- Stratify the leading causes of death by age group and observe trends

Haoyang Wang is focusing on investigating the top leading causes of
death in NYC and the high morbidity of Cerebrovascular Disease in NYC by
analyzing the following:

- Visualize the top leading causes of death in NYC by morbidity with bar
  plot.

- Visualize the top leading causes of death in NYC by neighborhood.

- Analyze the major factors contributing to one of the top leading
  causes of death in NYC, Cerebrovascular Disease.

- Conducting statistical analyses investigating the correlation between
  these factors and NYC. In other ways, does NYC has a higher morbidity
  of Cerebrovascular Disease and why.

Angelica Vina-Albarracin will focus on Alzheimer’s disease and other
causes of dementia in NYC:

- Visualize changes over time in Alzheimer’s disease diagnoses and the
  number of deaths attributed to Alzheimer.

- Conduct statistical analysis to understand the relationship between
  individual-level factors such as income, years of education, family
  history, etc., and the risk of death from Alzheimer’s diseases.

- Analyze and visualize the distribution of Alzheimer’s diseases and
  dementia deaths by NYC neighborhood, and explore which factors at the
  neighborhood-level might be contributing to these differences.

- Explore the correlations between Alzheimer’s disease and other
  chronic/preventable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. How
  are these diseases contributing to the changing patterns of
  Alzheimer’s disease over time? What socioeconomic factors, such as
  income and access to preventative health care, might contribute to an
  increase/decrease risk of Alzheimer’s?
